        Charibin, LLC. ("Charibin", "us", or "we") is committed to respecting and protecting
        the privacy of our Users. This Privacy Policy, which is part of our overall Terms of
        Service, covers personal information collected about our Users, which includes users
        of Charibin Service (as defined in our Terms of Service), visitors to our web Site
        (www.charibin.com, or "the Site"), and Merchants to Charibin (who are subject to
        additional Merchant Terms).
        Please review this Privacy Policy to better understand our practices as they apply to
        personal information. By using Charibin Service or accessing the Site, you consent to
        the data practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this
        Privacy Policy, or any of the terms in the Terms of Service (including the Merchant
        Terms if you are a Merchant), you may not continue to use Charibin Service or visit
        the Site.
      </p>
      <h4>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
      <p>
        From time to time, we may modify this Privacy Policy in our sole discretion. If we
        make any updates or changes to this Privacy Policy, all modifications will be posted
        to this Site, and will be effective immediately upon our posting. Using Charibin, or
        using the Site, after updates are posted and effective constitutes acceptance of any
        changes.
      </p>
      <h4>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h4>
      <p>
        We collect personal information of all Users of Charibin (including visitors to its
        Site), which may include name, phone number, address, email address, and payment
        information. We may require you to provide personal information to interact with or
        register for the Site. We require you to register for the Site in order to use Charibin
        Service or to act as a Merchant to Charibin. If you participate in our opinion polls,
        surveys, contests, or sweepstakes, we may collect additional personal information about
        you in connection with your response or entry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, you may choose to make other personal information available to us in
        connection with the consignment of an item, when you submit a video or blog for
        publication on the Site, email us, or invite a friend to join the Site.
      </p>
      <h4>USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>
      <p>
        We use the personal information we collect to provide you with information, products,
        and services that you request and that we believe may be of interest to you. We use the
        personal information that we collect to register users, process requests and orders
        (including membership registration), communicate with you, provide you with other services,
        offers, and updates, as well as to administer our Site and comply with applicable laws.
      </p>
      <h5>COMMUNICATING WITH YOU</h5>
      <p>
        We may communicate with you about topics we believe you may be interested in, including
        through newsletters, alerts, and reminders about recurring event sales. From time to time
        we may send you service-related emails, such as a welcome email when you register for the
        Site.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you provide us personal information when you communicate with us (including in person,
          by phone, or via email) this information may be shared with a Customer Care representative,
        employee, or expert that is most likely to be able to address your inquiry. This information
        will be used only for the purpose of responding to your inquiry.
      </p>
      <h5>INVITATIONS</h5>
      <p>
        When you invite a friend to join our Site, we will automatically send your friend an email
        invitation on your behalf. We will not use your friendâ€™s email address for any other purpose
        unless they join our Site or request further information or response from us. Similarly, when
        you email a message using the Invite a Friend function, we do not store the email addresses
        that are used to facilitate the email communication.
      </p>
      <h5>OPINION POLLS AND SURVEYS</h5>
      <p>
        We may share personal information we collect from your responses to opinion polls or surveys
        with third parties. If we do so, we will provide you with notice and the opportunity to consent.
      </p>
      <h5>CONTESTS AND AUCTIONS</h5>
      <p>
        If you enter a contest or auction conducted by Charibin and/or one of our partners, we may
        contact you in connection with that particular contest or sweepstakes, including in order to
        update you regarding your status, administer the promotion, or let you know that a promotion
        has ended.
      </p>
      <h5>ONLINE TRACKING</h5>
      <p>
        Like most websites, we, our service providers, and our third-party partners may collect
        certain information about your interaction with our Site. This information may be stored
        in log files. Information stored in log files may include Internet Protocol (IP) addresses,
        browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time
        stamp, and other information.
      </p>
      <p>
        We collect this information through the use of cookies and other similar technologies. We use
        this information to analyze demographic and other trends, administer the site, track aggregate
        usage of the Site, and provide you with relevant advertising.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because an industry-standard Do-Not-Track protocol is not yet established, the choices we offer
        will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy independent of any Do-Not-Track
        signals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your Privacy Choices, and right to control our use of your personal information, are described
        below.
      </p>
      <h4>SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
      <h5>THIRD PARTIES</h5>
      <p>
        We may provide contractors access to your personal information in the course of assisting in
        operating our business and providing products or services to you. These contractors include
        vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services and/or content for the
        operation and maintenance of our Site or Service. Access to your personal information by
        these contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary for the contractor to
        perform its limited function. We require our contractors to keep the personal information
        they are provided confidential and to comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will not rent, sell or share your personal information with third parties without your
        consent except to provide you with a product or service you request or as described in this
        Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <h5>LEGAL DISCLAIMER</h5>
      <p>
        We may disclose personal information pursuant to a request from law enforcement or pursuant
        to other legal or regulatory process, or as otherwise required by law, or, in our sole
        discretion, to protect our rights, property or interests, including to enforce this Privacy
        Policy or our Terms of Service. In the event that we are legally compelled to disclose your
        personal information to a third party, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you unless
        doing so would violate the law or court order.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our sole discretion, we may also disclose information we collect to a third party when we
        believe it is reasonably necessary to investigate or prevent harm, fraud, abuse, or illegal
        conduct.
      </p>
      <p>
        Information collected from this site may also be transferred as part of a merger or other
        combination, or as part of a restructuring, bankruptcy, transfer of assets, or to our successors
        in interest.
      </p>
      <h4>YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES</h4>
      <h5>UPDATES TO YOUR INFORMATION</h5>
      <p>
        At your request, we will make efforts to update, change or delete personal information
        Charibin maintains about you. In order to enforce the terms of this Privacy Policy, resolve
        disputes, or provide information to satisfy applicable governmental laws, regulations,
        investigations or proceedings, we may need to retain your personal information in our files.
      </p>
      <h5>CHOICE/OPT-OUT</h5>
      <p>
        Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletters, alerts, or promotional communications
        may opt-out of receiving these communications.
      </p>
      <h5>HOW TO EXERCISE YOUR CHOICES</h5>
      <p>
        You may notify us of your choices or preferences by contacting us as set forth in the
        "How to Contact Us" section below.
      </p>
      <h4>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</h4>
      <h5>TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h5>
      <p>
        Personal information collected from this Site will be transferred to and processed in the
        United States, and may be transferred and processed to other countries outside of your country
        of residence. We may also transfer personal information to service providers or other third
        parties with whom we have contractual agreements. Other countries where your personal
        information may be processed may have different legal protections for personal information
        than your country of origin, including different standards for access by law enforcement,
        courts, or other governmental authorities. Do not use this Site if you do not agree to the
        transfer and processing of your personal information in the United States or other countries
        outside your country of residence, or by third parties with whom we have contractual agreements
        that include requirements for privacy and security measures.
      </p>
      <h5>THIRD PARTY WEBSITES</h5>
      <p>
        This Site contains links to other websites provided by third parties. Please be aware that
        we do not control these third party websites or any of the content contained on those websites.
        Once you have left our Site, we cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of such other
        websites. We encourage you to exercise caution and to read the privacy policy for the website
        you visit. The inclusion of hyperlinks to third party websites on our site in no way constitutes
        an endorsement by us of such websites' content, actions or policies.
      </p>
      <h5>AGGREGATED INFORMATION</h5>
      <p>
        We may share aggregated information about you with third parties. Aggregated information is
        non-personal information about you that is combined with the non-personal information of other
        users. We may not limit the third parties' use of the aggregated information.
      </p>
      <h5>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h5>
      <p>
        California's "Shine The Light" law permits California residents to annually request and obtain
        information free of charge about what personal information is disclosed to third parties for
        direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. Charibin does not distribute your
        personal information to outside parties for their direct marketing, except as provided for in
        this Privacy Policy, without your consent.
      </p>
      <h5>ACCESS BY CHILDREN OR MINORS</h5>
      <p>
        Our Site is not directed to children under the age of 13, and our Terms of Service prohibit
        minors from using our Site or Service. We do not knowingly collect any information from children
        under 13.
      </p>
      <h5>SECURITY</h5>
      <p>
        We take precautions to protect information that we collect from our Users. We protect the
        information entrusted to us through physical, technical and administrative safeguards. These
        protections include restricting access to personal information to employees who need the
        information to perform a specific job. Charibin provides its employees training on its security
        and privacy practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, no information security safeguards can be guaranteed to be completely secure, so you
        should use caution whenever providing personal information online, electronically or otherwise.
      </p>
      <h5>HOW TO CONTACT US</h5>
      <p>
